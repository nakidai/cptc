CPTC (https://github.com/nakidai/cptc)
--------------------------------------
PetTheCord but rewritten in the C cuz some people were annoying me about that a
lot.

Before run you should set CPTC_TOKEN to some discord's user or bot token, so it
will be possible to request avatar location.

Paths:
/           Show this text
/<UID>.*    Return a gif that pets given UID
